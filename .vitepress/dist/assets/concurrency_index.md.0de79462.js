There is nothing to be afraid of, Jule safety tries to keep your security quite high in terms of concurrency due to its compiler, which is obsessed with it.</p><p>Jule uses real threads. That is, threads scheduled by the kernel. Jule does not use any coroutine/green threads. And also concurrent calls are not traced or synchronized. Therefore, your program may terminate before all your concurrent calls have finished executing.</p><h2 id="concurrent-calls" tabindex="-1">Concurrent Calls <a class="header-anchor" href="#concurrent-calls" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Concurrent Calls&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Jule, concurrent calls spawn a new thread. Concurrent calls are made with the <code>co</code> keyword.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="language-jule line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">jule</span><pre class="shiki github-dark"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F97583;">co</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8;"> </span><span style="color:#79B8FF;">my_function</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8;">()</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>Now your call to &quot;my_function&quot; is running concurrently. You can call any function for concurrency with some safety constraints.</p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You cannot use any function that has reference parameters for concurrency. At least with Safe Jule. Because the scopes of the references must be traceable by compiler, a kind of safety obsession of compiler. Concurrent calls break this. During concurrency, your reference may fall into a dangling position, which can be a serious problem. To avoid this, Safe Jule does not allow this, but if you are aware of what you are doing, Unsafe Jule will allow you to use a function with reference parameters for concurrency.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="language-jule line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">jule</span><pre class="shiki github-dark"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F97583;">unsafe</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8;"> { </span><span style="color:#F97583;">co</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8;"> </span><span style="color:#79B8FF;">my_function</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8;">(my_var) }</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div>',12),c=[s];function t(l,i,u,p,d,h){return n(),a("div",null,c)}const m=e(o,[["render",t]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
