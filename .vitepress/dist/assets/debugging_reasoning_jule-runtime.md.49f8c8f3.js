In this context, since you are sure that there will be no problem, it may be useful for you to check the exceptions that you use without handling them. If it uses error coding as an exceptional exception, you will get its code and you can understand what the problem might be thanks to these codes. Even otherwise, since you will have location information, you can make a good start by identifying the relevant place.</p><h2 id="common-runtime-panics" tabindex="-1">Common Runtime Panics <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-runtime-panics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common Runtime Panics&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>invalid memory address or nil pointer deference</code><br> Tried to access invalid memory.

Casting to a wrong type often causes this panic.</p><hr><p><code>memory allocation failed</code><br> An attempt was made to allocate memory via the heap at runtime but failed.
