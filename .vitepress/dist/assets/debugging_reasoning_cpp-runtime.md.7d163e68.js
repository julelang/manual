If you think that your previous codes are incompatible with your new codes or something similar, you may need to check your code and the runtime of your algorithm.</p><p>In some cases you may have an infinite recursion or a very deep recursion. Jule doesn&#39;t have a high-level call-stack implementation by default to make it easier for you to catch these. For example, C# will throw <code>System.StackOverflowException</code> in such a case. Examining the backtrace using your backend compiler&#39;s debuggers, if supported, will help you understand stack overflow problems.
