## Structs
```jule
struct Const
```
Constant data.\
Use `Const.new_nil` function istead of `Const{}` for nil literal.

**Methods:**

`static fn new_i64(x: i64): &Const`\

`fn set_str(mut self, x: str)`\
Sets constant value from string.

`fn set_f64(mut self, x: f64)`\
Sets constant value from 64-bit floating-point.

`fn set_nil(mut self)`\
Sets constant value to nil.

`fn is_i64(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is 64-bit signed integer.

`fn is_u64(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is 64-bit unsigned integer.

`fn is_bool(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is boolean.

`fn is_str(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is string.

`fn is_f64(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is 64-bit floating-point.

`fn is_nil(self): bool`\
Reports whether data is nil.

`fn are_same_types(self, x: Const): bool`\
Reports whether self and x has same type.

`fn and(self, x: Const): bool`\
Reports whether self and x are true.\
Returns false if type is not supported.

`fn or(self, x: Const): bool`\
Reports whether self or x is true.\
Returns false if type is not supported.

`fn eqs(self, x: Const): bool`\
Reports whether self and x are equals.\
Returns false if type is not supported. 

`fn lt(self, x: Const): bool`\
Reports whether self less than x.\
Returns false if type is unsupported by operation.

Supported types are:
- 64-bit signed integer
- 64-bit unsigned integer
- 64-bit floating-point
