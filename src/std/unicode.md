static WHITE_SPACE: &RangeTable
```

---

```jule
static CASE_RANGES: []CaseRange
```
The table describing case mappings for all letters with non-self mappings.

---

```jule
static FOLD_CATEGORY: [str:&RangeTable]
```
Maps a category name to a table of code points outside the category that are equivalent under simple case folding to code points inside the category. If there is NO entry for a category name, there are NO such points.

---

```jule
static FOLD_SCRIPT: [str:&RangeTable]
```
Maps a script name to a table of code points outside the script that are equivalent under simple case folding to code points inside the script. If there is NO entry for a script name, there are NO such points.

---

```jule
static GRAPHIC_RANGES: []&RangeTable
```
Defines the set of graphic characters according to Unicode.

## Functions

```jule
fn to(case: int, mut r: rune): rune
```
Maps the rune to the specified case: UpperCase, LowerCase, or TitleCase.

---

```jule
fn to_upper(mut r: rune): rune
```
Maps the rune to upper case.

---

```jule
fn to_lower(mut r: rune): rune
```
Maps the rune to lower case.

---

```jule
fn is(range_tab: &RangeTable, r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is in the specified table of ranges.

---

```jule
fn is_upper(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is an upper case letter.

---

```jule
fn is_lower(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a lower case letter.

---

```jule
fn is_digit(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a decimal digit.

---

```jule
fn is_letter(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a letter (category L).

---

```jule
fn is_number(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a number (category N).

---

```jule
fn is_punct(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a Unicode punctuation character (category P).

---

```jule
fn is_space(r: rune): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a space character as defined by Unicode's White Space property; in the Latin-1 space this is

`'\t'`, `'\n'`, `'\v'`, `'\f'`, `'\r'`, `' '`, `U+0085` (NEL), `U+00A0` (NBSP).

Other definitions of spacing characters are set by category Z and property PATTERN_WHITE_SPACE.

---

```jule
fn is_graphic(r: rune): bool
```
Such characters include letters, marks, numbers punctuation, symbols, and spaces, from categories L, M, N, P, S, ZS.

---

```jule
fn is_in(r: rune, ranges: ...&RangeTable): bool
```
Reports whether the rune is a member of one of the ranges.

## Structs

```jule
struct Range16 {
    lo:     u16
    hi:     u16
    stride: u16
}
```
Represents of a range of 16-bit Unicode code points. The range runs from lo to hi inclusive and has the specified stride.

---

```jule
struct Range32 {
    lo:     u16
    hi:     u16
    stride: u16
}
```
Represents of a range of Unicode code points and is used when one or more of the values will not fit in 16 bits. The range runs from lo to hi inclusive and has the specified stride. lo and hi must always be >= 1<<16.

---

```jule
struct RangeTable {
    r16:          []Range16
    r32:          []Range32
    latin_offset: int
}
```
Defines a set of Unicode code points by listing the ranges of code points within the set. The ranges are listed in two slices to save space: a slice of 16-bit ranges and a slice of 32-bit ranges. The two slices must be in sorted order and non-overlapping. Also, r32 should contain only values >= 0x10000 (1<<16).
