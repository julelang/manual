## New32
```jule
fn New32(): hash::Hash32
```
Returns a new 32-bit FNV-1 \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.

## New64
```jule
fn New64(): hash::Hash64
```
Returns a new 64-bit FNV-1 \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.

## New128
```jule
fn New128(): hash::Hash
```
Returns a new 128-bit FNV-1 \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.

## New32a
```jule
fn New32a(): hash::Hash32
```
Returns a new 32-bit FNV-1a \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.

## New64a
```jule
fn New64a(): hash::Hash64
```
Returns a new 64-bit FNV-1a \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.

## New128a
```jule
fn New128a(): hash::Hash
```
Returns a new 128-bit FNV-1a \[hash::Hash\]. Its Sum method will lay the value out in big-endian byte order.
