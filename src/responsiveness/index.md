# Responsiveness

Jule tries to be as responsive as possible. This is the responsibility of the compiler. This intuition may arise at different points in different topics such as mutability or expressions.

The base reason for such responsiveness is to further increase simplicity. Of course, without creating uncertainties or making things more difficult. Code that looks simple may not always be simple to read, so it needs to be balanced.

Considering this balance, Jule tries to be as intuitive as possible. This intuitiveness may have different advantages; It could be shorter code, more flexible mutability or simplicity.

This section documents where responsiveness is available and how.
