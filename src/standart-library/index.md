# Standart Library

The standard library is language's own library. Usually each programming language have a standard library. This libraries, provides common functions to developer. Free time!

Developers can write functions of standard library if they want. But they usually prefer to use the standard library. Because usually every developer learns the standard library while learning a language. For this reason, standard library provides readability for developers. Since developers do not rewrite their functions every time, developers who already know the standard library can understand the code more easily.
