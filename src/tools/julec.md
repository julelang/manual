# julec

The reference compiler of the Jule programming language.

julec is the only official compiler developed for the Jule programming language. It was developed with the Jule programming language. It is also a reference for the minimum competency that the Jule specification must have. Any third-party Jule compiler must have at least all the capabilities that the reference compiler has in order to achieve sufficient proficiency.

julec largely uses the [`std/jule`](/std/jule) package and its subpackages from the standard library. What it does independently of these libraries is IR optimization and object code generation.
