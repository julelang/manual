# Variables

## Linking Variables

After the header file containing the C++ variables is passed to Jule, C++ variables must be declared to Jule. Not all, just the ones you will use. But remember, JuleC does not check header files. Your declarations are reliable. The compiler assumes that the definitions exist and are correctly defined.

For example:
```jule
cpp let tickrate: int
```
